#GStreamer is a framework for plugins, data flow, and media type handling/negotiation. 
 It is used to create streaming media applications



# Open source GStreamer plugins:
GstFileSrc - Read data from a file: video data or images.
GstH264Parse - Parse the incoming H264 stream. For H265 codec, use H265Parse.
GstRtpH264Pay - Convert H264 encoded payload to RTP packets (RFC 3984).
GstUDPSink - Send UDP packets to the network. When paired with RTP payloader (GstRtpH264Pay) it can implement RTP streaming.
GstCapsFilter - Enforce limitations on data format without modifying data.
GstV4l2Src - Capture video from v4l2 devices.
GstMP4Mux - Merge streams (audio and video) into ISO MPEG-4 (.mp4) files.
GstFileSink - Write incoming data to a file in the local file system.
GstURIDecodeBin - Decode data from a URI into raw media. It selects a source element that can handle the given "uri" scheme and connects it to a decodebin.


#NVIDIA Hardware Accelerated plugins:
Gst-nvstreammux - Batch streams before sending for AI inference.
Gst-nvinfer - Run inference using TensorRT.
Gst-nvvideo4linux2 - Decode video streams using the hardware accelerated decoder (NVDEC); Encode RAW data in I420 format to H264 or H265 output video stream using hardware accelerated encoder (NVENC).
Gst-nvvideoconvert - Perform video color format conversion. The first Gst-nvvideoconvert plugin before Gst-nvdsosd plugin converts stream data from I420 to RGBA and the second Gst-nvvideoconvert plugin after Gst-nvdsosd plugin converts data from RGBA to I420.
Gst-nvdsosd - Draw bounding boxes, text, and region of interest (ROI) polygons.
Gst-nvtracker - Track object between frames.
Gst-nvmultistreamtiler - Composite a 2D tile from batched buffers.
Gst-nvv4l2decoder - Decode a video stream.
Gst-Nvv4l2h264enc - Encode a video stream.
