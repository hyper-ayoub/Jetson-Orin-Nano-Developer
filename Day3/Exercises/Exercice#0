DeepStream Course Notebooks:
The following list is a summary of the exercise notebooks included in the course. Additional details about each can be found in the introduction notebook. Give them a try!
Object Detection Application
Notebook 1: Build a DeepStream pipeline to find objects in a video stream, and modify the configuration to change the objects detected.

Analysis with Metadata
Notebook 2: Extract metadata from the pipeline, analyze it, and add information such as object counts to the video annotation.

Multiple Networks Application
Notebook 3: Build a DeepStream application to find objects in a video stream, pass those images through multiple classification networks, and display detailed information about the objects in the output stream.

Multiple Stream Input
Notebook 4: Add the ability to run inference on multiple input streams with a tiled output.

Video File Output
Notebook 5: Add the ability to save an annotated video stream to a file in the format of your choice, for download and later use.

Using Different Neural Networks
Requires an Internet connection to the Jetson Nano
Notebook 6: Change the neural network in the DeepStream Pipeline to another, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once).

Disclaimer: The YOLO model is an open model taken from https://pjreddie.com/darknet and https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet. NVIDIA doesn't guarantee accuracy of this model. The accuracy might vary based on the video.
Tip: You can try your own videos with this lab, or download some from the Internet from sites such as https://www.pexels.com/ or https://www.videvo.net/.
Live Stream
Requires a USB webcam connected to the Jetson Nano
Notebook 7: Run inference on a live stream from a webcam connected to the Jetson Nano.
