You'll be able to watch the streams on your computer using the media player. If you did not install it yet, do so before beginning the exercises: refer back to the Install Media Player and Run Media Player sections.
  3: Log into the Jetson Nano at 192.168.55.1:8888 and enter the password dlinano if prompted.
